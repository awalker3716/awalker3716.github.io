      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="bio-container">
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Mandy! I graduated from high school with high honors, then pursued studies in biomolecular science at
          Clarkson University
          and later delved into computer programming at Syracuse University. Over the years, I have developed a well
          rounded skill-set, I have vast
          experience in web design, and have completed many projects, including the creation of this page. I have also
          worked a multide of jobs throughout my studies, I am well versed in customer service, and can easily manage a
          team in a stressful situations.
        </p>
        <p>
Currently, I am eager to enter the web development indusutry, using my proficiency in HTML and CSS, while actively expanding my knowledge set.
        Engaged in multiple onlines courses focusing on Javascript, SQL and Python and more. I tend to stay up to date with the always expanding knowledge of technology. 
</p>
        <p>I am always looking for new opportunities and have decided to combine all my
          skills and start my own business! </p>
        I am still exploring all the different aveneues i can take my business down, but I am positive that I want web
        development to be an important aspect of it.
        </p>
